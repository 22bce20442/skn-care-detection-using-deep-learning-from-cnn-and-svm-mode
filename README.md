# Skin Care Detection using Deep Learning (CNN and SVM)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting skin conditions using a hybrid approach of
Deep Learning and Machine Learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used
to extract deep features from skin images, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
is used for final classification.

This approach improves classification accuracy, especially when the dataset
size is limited.
